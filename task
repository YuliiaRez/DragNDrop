Overview
1. Create a program in any programming language you are comfortable with that keeps track of an ordered, numbered list of names. 

2. We should have users, but the list is one for all users. Meanwhile, each user should have their own order.

3. Each name should have a rank (numbered) associated with it and be displayed in the program.

4. The list should be sorted ascending based on rank.

5. You should be able to re-order the list, moving a name up or down 
the list to change its associated rank. This can be with drop-downs or drag-and-drop or any method of your choosing, as long as it works.

6. You should be able to add to and delete from the list.

7. You should be able to edit an item in the list.

8. Clean and working code is what we're looking for. Your code should be ready to clone on bitbucket/github with clear instructions on how to compile and run

9. Please track your time from beginning to end of your development and mention it in walkthrough. When you have completed the challenge, please record a video walking us through your code and the logic/thought process behind how you approached the challenge. If you have wireframes etc, please include that in your walkthrough as well
